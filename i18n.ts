      'faq.question-2': 'How does it find duplicates?',
      'faq.answer-2': 'Dedup finds duplicates based on the songs identifier, title, artist, and duration similarity. It identifies duplicates that Spotify\'s application does not catch.',
      'faq.question-3': 'How is Dedup better than Spotify\'s built-in duplicate detection?',
      'faq.answer-3': 'Spotify\'s applications only warn about duplicates when adding a song to a playlit or liked songs with the exact same song identifier. However, the same song can have multiple identifiers on Spotify that both in the same release or in several ones. Dedup detects duplicates based on title, artist, and duration similarity.',
      'faq.question-4': 'When duplicates are found, which songs are removed?',
      'faq.answer-4': 'Dedup will keep the first song within a group of duplicate songs, and will remove the rest.',
      'faq.question-5': 'Is my data safe with this web application?',
      'faq.answer-5': 'Yes, this web application does not store any user data on its servers. It only requests the minimum set of permissions necessary to process your library.',
      'faq.question-6': 'What permissions does this web application require?',
      'faq.answer-6': 'This web application uses Spotify\'s authentication service to access your liked songs and playlists in your library.',
      'faq.question-7': 'How has this tool been tested?',
      'faq.answer-7': 'This tool has been battle-tested by thousands of users who have used it to identify duplicates in millions of playlists since 2014.',
      'faq.question-8': 'Can this tool delete duplicates across multiple playlists?',
      'faq.answer-8': 'This tool can identify and delete duplicates on all playlists in a library, but doesn\'t detect duplicates of a song across multiple playlists.',
      'faq.question-9': 'How can I revoke the permissions granted to this web application?',
      'faq.answer-9': 'You can revoke the permissions granted to this web application at any time on your Spotify account, under the \'Apps\' section.',
      'faq.question-10': 'Does this tool work with other music streaming services?',
      'faq.answer-10': 'No, this tool only works with Spotify through Spotify\'s Web API.',
